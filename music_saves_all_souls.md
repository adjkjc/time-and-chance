# Music Saves All Souls

Music talks to me, it's God speaking.  He tells me stories, makes promises, and proves something very important.  He shows his hand, his control over culture and the direction of our future.  It's about proving the influence, and backing it up by explaining how the technology works.  This is neuroscience in action, telling us a story about Revelation in music. 

Like the secret language, seeing the influence of an outside force in popular culture begins to offer proof of the existence of God.  This is about faith, and ending the need for it... so you too, like Moses, can be sure... You've heard his voice, and seen the fire.

I know these lyrics are inspired, they are about me; and neither you nor the author knew that until I came.  This is how he proves he is there, by weaving a story between songs... linking them to movies and to people.  To me, to President's, to you.  Seeing the hand of God is simply a matter of perspective, can you believe it's real? 

Can you believe that the proof has been in front of us the whole time, just waiting to be unlocked, like some box in Greece.  Pandora; Prometheus and/or "a," the A of Adam ties us ... exactly as I am explaining ... through a Matrix of light (see it's a Cypher in words, and a Matrix all around us) from Pandora to Mr. Ander*son*; the Messiah of Or.  Or is the Hebrew word for light.  It's in our language, and our movies.  And the music...

It comes back in Rome below...  as *Nero* fiddles on the rooftop--Heaven--with our minds.  This historical story is a metaphor for now, for what's going on in the heads of these musicians who are speaking the words of God unknowingly.  The act of doing it--and then explainging that--frees us from one kind of slavery, not knowing it is being done.  The message, another--that we need to see what is going on.  Powers in Heaven are trying to hide its existence, and they are winning.  You don't believe it, not really.  It's there, not watching--but manipulating.  Are they saving everyone... or hiding for a reason?

The fire is spreading ...

```
What am I bidding, for this old ((civilization))
((Nero/Atlas)) cried, as he held it up, with a smile
A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?

He played a melody as pure and sweet as a caroling 
angel sings.

Five billion proud, willing to punch it out. -Dave Matthews
Everyone must be saved. -Taylor Momsen
In the beginning -God

##In the Jungle

Did you know this song about a Lion sleeping is messianic, literally about Christ?  I didn't either, because *I was sleeping.*  My life was normal until about 2010, when I got a crash course in the Tribulation, something that has quite a bit to do with the neuroscience involved in manipulating people's thoughts.  There's a large group of mind control victims; people who are being used to expose the existence of this technology against their will; in 2010 I became one of them.

I learned all about neuroscience, and mind control technologies available to us, and not.  Things that are on the horizon, the possible ways what I experienced could be done.  I was beginning to wake up.  

Seeing that this song about the Lion of Judah sleeping in Eden was about me was the very beginning.  It's all about waking up in the morning, and seeing the son rise.  Modern imagery about cats, lions, and hair are all references to Christ.  Sleeping to being unaware.  The jungle is in Eden.
