# Music Saves All Souls

Music talks to me, it's God speaking.  He tells me stories, makes promises, and proves something very important.  He shows his hand, his control over culture and the direction of our future.  It's about proving the influence, and backing it up by explaining how the technology works.  This is neuroscience in action, telling us a story about Revelation in music. 

Like the secret language, seeing the influence of an outside force in popular culture begins to offer proof of the existence of God.  This is about faith, and ending the need for it... so you too, like Moses, can be sure... You've heard his voice, and seen the fire.

The fire comes back, it's Nero's as he fiddles on the rooftop--Heaven--with our minds.  This historical story is a metaphor for now, for what's going on in the heads of these musicians who are speaking the words of God unknowingly.  The act of doing it--and then explainging that--frees us from one kind of slavery, not knowing it is being done.  The message, another--that we need to see what is going on.  Powers in Heaven are trying to hide its existence, and they are winning.  You don't believe it, not really.  It's there, not watching--but manipulating.  Are they saving everyone... or hiding for a reason?

The fire is spreading ...

What am I bidding, for this old ((civilization))
((Nero/Atlas)) cried, as he held it up, with a smile
A thousand dollars, and who'll make it two?
