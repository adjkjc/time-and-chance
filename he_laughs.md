# He Laughs

The story of Isaac's near sacrifice is highly commented on in the Zohar, the book of Jewish light.  It shows a significant amount of humor and sarcasm associated with some sexual innuendo that also links Isaac to Adam in Eden.  The name Isaac means "he laughs" in Hebrew, though there is not much for him to be laughing at upon first glance.  The Zohar also dates the date of the attempt on his life to his 37th year, much later than most people think; and directly in line with the time frame that is generally accepted for the Crucifixion.

This is what it appears he is laughing at, you see Isaac knew he was going to be killed, because he had read the books about his death--the prophesies that were designed in order to influence humanity (the true father) not to kill Adam.  His laughter grew louder as it appeared that perhaps he is God, and unable to be killed, but that's down the line a bit.  Upon having his murder called off one loud resounding "Ha" came from his mouth.  This "Ha" was donated to his father's name, changing Avram to Abraham; only that name change happened first upon his Covenant with God.  These events, as well as the apparent time inversion are inextricably linked.

###Ha is SEM, the "Save Everyone Messiah"

The word Messiah backwards reveals that "Ha" which is short for Isaac in my personal mythology because of his names English meaning and the donation to Abraham.  This Ha comes up again during Christ's miraculous feeding of the multitude "two fish."  This miracle, as well as many other references to feeding the people, is a reference to a teaching... one you are about to receive.

The two fish are commonly held to be references to the two prophets, Elisha and Elija, and these two names are very special.  Like Jesus and Jeshurun they are equalities, using the English word "is" this time.  *El* is the proper name of the ancient Hebrew diety, and our equality here tells me that Isaac and El are one.  The Hispanic and English laughs, Ha and Ja are also related by the association of the two names.

What's more, these equalities link the English and Hebrew words for "the" in exactly the same order that Jeshurun equates the two renditions of "is."  Just like SEM, I have acronym for "the," and it is the true purpose of God: *to help everyone.*  To help us understand these ancient names are showing prescient knowledge of both the English and Hebrew languages thousands of years before that was possible.  Just like a Rosetta stone, not only are we seeing the words, but their meanings are being directly connected to each other.

To really tie this to reality, I bring back the light of the word Exodus in reverse.  The name of that book in the Hebrew language translates to "names," and if you recall the Element highlighted, xe, is also the name of Oracle Corporations' database.  

###Larry Ellison, the founder of that company, follows the pattern of the names of Elisha and Elija, telling us that *El is the son.*

###ha'esh
There are a significant number of religious uses of the prefix Ha, which makes sense as it is the superlative "the" making its modifier "holy."  Earlier we talked about Ha'esh, the word for the Holy Flame of the Burning Bush.  This is the bush that would not burn to ash, and the *ha* here is more than meets the eye.  You see the Hebrew word for fire, "esh" has absolutely nothing to do with ash, and yet this joke seems to imply knowledge of a relationship between the words "ash" and "esh," again indicating knowledge of a language that was yet to exist.

###The True Name of God is Adam
This is somewhat obvious when you think about it, the name of the planet Earth in Hebrew is Adamah, which means "ground."  Literally it means to swirl around Adam, and it is a good example of what you might have called Eden, the place where God was searching for Adam.  Here though, it makes more sense in the context of Matthew 2:2, where humanity is searching for the Second Adam... the Christ... all over the planet Earth.  

###ha'shem
Wouldn't you guess there's a joke on the way.  The name of God is a sacred secret in Judaism, and it must not be uttered.  The ineffable name is thus replaced with descriptions or abbreviations in order to keep its secret safe.  One such description is Ha'shem which literally means "the name."  This is a direct reference to Eden, and the laughter is once again geared at the obvious foreknowledge of English in the construction of Hebrew and religion.  There is *no shame* for Adam, who knows he is the savior.

###ha'meforash 
Yet another rendition of "the name," and now an entire English sentence which also ties in the word "ash."  The savior is laughing about being accused of cursing the Earth.. ashes to ashes, now to esh.
