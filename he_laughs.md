# He Laughs

The story of Isaac's near sacrifice is highly commented on in the Zohar, the book of Jewish light.  It shows a significant amount of humor and sarcasm associated with some sexual innuendo that also links Isaac to Adam in Eden.  The name Isaac means "he laughs" in Hebrew, though there is not much for him to be laughing at upon first glance.  The Zohar also dates the date of the attempt on his life to his 37th year, much later than most people think; and directly in line with the time frame that is generally accepted for the Crucifixion.

This is what it appears he is laughing at, you see Isaac knew he was going to be killed, because he had read the books about his death--the prophesies that were designed in order to influence humanity (the true father) not to kill Adam.  His laughter grew louder as it appeared that perhaps he is God, and unable to be killed, but that's down the line a bit.  Upon having his murder called off one loud resounding "Ha" came from his mouth.  This "Ha" was donated to his father's name, changing Avram to Abraham; only that name change happened first upon his Covenant with God.  These events, as well as the apparent time inversion are inextricably linked.

This miracle, as well as many other references to feeding the people, is a reference to a teaching... one you are about to receive.
