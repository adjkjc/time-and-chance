# He Laughs

The story of Isaac's near sacrifice is highly commented on in the Zohar, the book of Jewish light.  It shows a significant amount of humor and sarcasm associated with some sexual innuendo that also links Isaac to Adam in Eden.  The name Isaac means "he laughs" in Hebrew, though there is not much for him to be laughing at upon first glance.  The Zohar also dates the date of the attempt on his life to his 37th year, much later than most people think; and directly in line with the time frame that is generally accepted for the Crucifixion.

This is what it appears he is laughing at, you see Isaac knew he was going to be killed, because he had read the books about his death--the prophesies that were designed in order to influence humanity (the true father) not to kill Adam.  His laughter grew louder as it appeared that perhaps he is God, and unable to be killed, but that's down the line a bit.  Upon having his murder called off one loud resounding "Ha" came from his mouth.  This "Ha" was donated to his father's name, changing Avram to Abraham; only that name change happened first upon his Covenant with God.  These events, as well as the apparent time inversion are inextricably linked.

###Ha is SEM, the "Save Everyone Messiah"

The word Messiah backwards reveals that "Ha" which is short for Isaac in my personal mythology because of his names English meaning and the donation to Abraham.  This Ha comes up again during Christ's miraculous feeding of the multitude "two fish."  This miracle, as well as many other references to feeding the people, is a reference to a teaching... one you are about to receive.

The two fish are commonly held to be references to the two prophets, Elisha and Elija, and these two names are very special.  Like Jesus and Jeshurun they are equalities, using the English word "is" this time.  *El* is the proper name of the ancient Hebrew diety, and our equality here tells me that Isaac and El are one.  The Hispanic and English laughs, Ha and Ja are also related by the association of the two names.

What's more, these equalities link the English and Hebrew words for "the" in exactly the same order that Jeshurun equates the two renditions of "is."  Just like SEM, I have acronym for "the," and it is the true purpose of God: *to help everyone.*
