# The Redemption of Adam

###I have heard a voice, you're suffering through all this noise. -Taylor Momsen

I hear the voice of God, and a huge part of *what is going on around me*; which is a phrase that he uses quite often, is that I am quite sure that you deserve to hear it also.  In Exodus, Moses was admonished and kept from seeing the promised land because of his lack of "faith."  I've always found it funny, as he is probably one of the only people documented in the story that should have had no need for faith.  He too heard a voice.  That voice enabled him to part a sea, by walking into until his head was covered; he was underwater... and if idioms could help us understand God's message, *he was in way over his head.*

Still the commentary on his lack of faith is a highlight, it sticks out like a sore thumb: he had plenty of faith, and that much should be clear by his witnessing of more than just the burning bush, but numerous miraculous acts; the liberation of his people, and their continued sustenance through even more miracles like "manna from Heaven" and "water from a stone."  Moses crime was not a lack of faith, but rather one of impatience for suffering.  He demanded these miracles, and received them; one of the only instances of such an act, and for him it happened on a daily basis.

I know, because I know that Moses is Christ.  His superposition with Adam in the apocryphal "apocalypses" is a hint, and so is the correlation of the hidden symbolism of wandering through a storm in time... associated with the repetition of the number 40.  I also know that Moses name is an acronym; that, when expanded with some acronyms and Latin (
("e" is "to")--and an eye for the message and content of his purpose--it stands for "Messiah of Sea to Sea."  

The relationship between Moses and his parted seas is one of the most well laid hidden messages of the apocalypse.  It is correlated to the Egyptian story of the *uniting of two Lands* by their messiah, Horus.  Tied together through symbolism in American history; Paul Revere's midnight ride.  

###One of by "El and..." two if by (the parted) seas..

This message from within our history answers a question that most people probably never ever thought to ask, it is the number of Heavens that will result from our salvation during the period where Moses brings us proof of its existence, and a purpose for ours.  

I have heard a voice, one that speaks directly to me, and has now for a number of years.  Sometimes this "sounds" like my own thoughts, and sometimes it is external; but I have a unique ability to discern messages that are sent to me
