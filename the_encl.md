# The Encl

God is superstitious, he doesn't like the number 9, or the word end.  [Asherah he asks?  Ha'meforash.](hamd.md/he_laughs.md)  Saving the universe is the purpose of religion, and God's plan is to make angels of us.  Angels [born in the fire of Hell.](behold,_the_burning_bush.md)  This Hell is a storm of time travel that has caused us to relive our lives... at least 2 times, but probably many more, if you know me.

##I am the living vine.
Vine and tree references, like *The Tree of Knowledge* and *The Tree of Life* are references to a computer metaphor.  A decision tree, and this is what I believe the *multiverse* that quantum theorists are trying to explain is.  Not a construct of nature, but a design to save the Universe, a tool built to create branches in time, based on things we do.
