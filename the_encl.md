# The Encl

God is superstitious, he doesn't like the number 9, or the word end.  [Asherah he asks?  Ha'meforash.](hamd.md/he_laughs.md)  Saving the universe is the purpose of religion, and God's plan is to make angels of us.  Angels [born in the fire of Hell.](behold,_the_burning_bush.md)  This Hell is a storm of time travel that has caused us to relive our lives... at least 2 times, but probably many more, if you know me.

##I am the living vine.
Vine and tree references, like *The Tree of Knowledge* and *The Tree of Life* are references to a computer metaphor.  A decision tree, and this is what I believe the *multiverse* that quantum theorists are trying to explain is.  Not a [construct of nature, but a design](./outside_of_heaven.md) to save the Universe, a tool built to create branches in time, based on things we do.  

##The Creator's Light
###d = c + l, our glyphs, the letters of the Latin alphabet contain hidden messages.
This one is special, because it explains the domain that this book is located at, www.lamc.la.  I've broken the code, and the Greek letter Lamda, which is part of an "N."  It's an N to darkness, and an awakening to seeing that our languages, and letters, are designed with intelligent and hidden meaning.  Like ancient Heiroglyphs, our letters teach a path... and the N is the *new J*.

###J is for going back in time, and bringing everyone to Heaven.
