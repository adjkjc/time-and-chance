# I'm Single

None of the patterns that link together our cultural art into a Matrix of Biblical light are more intricate than the one that is designed to introduce the Messiah.  Bridging *The Fifth Element* with Shakespeare tied together with the *The Hand of God* yields the key to a "Cypher" that ties the Holiest number of all, 14, to Adam Dobrin.  

If "Iran" and "Amish" haven't convinced you that the Lord is writing truth not only in the product of our civilization--the heart of the word Earth (that's art), perhaps my personal favorite abstraction of *walking on water* will show you that it is the creation of America itself that is God's greatest miracle.  He's marked it with the discovery of the continent, his AM at the beginning of it's name, and a tie between the name "Christ" and my intials indexed to 14.

##ADIB, says the "I AM"
A sailor like Sinbad, Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue to bring democracy to you.  He did this in the year 1492, which translates roughly to "ADIB" (but probably only to me).  At the very beginning of America, 

```
Christ o PH "er" Columbus
       f ua  mo
         pp  eo
         rp  rm
         si  g
         un  e 
         ee  n
          s  c
          s  y

(How's that for the Matrix for you?)

documents the intrinsic relationship between Uncle Samael and the historical creation of the largest institution of democracy in the world.  Amerigo, Sinbad, Christopher... all names which have symbolic reference to the Fifth Element, a cinematic messiah in content that bring light from the hair of LeeLoo Dallas.  Echoing the "B" of ADIB as a grammatically poor identity statement; the image below should clarify how A.D. and Silicon are related to the true Fifth Element, Boron.   I don't think the symbolism in the name of the movie is hidden anymore, after seeing how it ties to the name "Sinbad."

Jesus replied, "Have I been with you all this time, 
and yet you still don't know who I am? 

Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father! 
So why are you asking me to show him to you?

John 14:9
```

The Book of Revelation for tells of a mystery, one which is partially solved by the name "Sinbad" and its application of The Fifth Element to Shakespeare's question to the ages: "To be or not to be?"

 

The solution heralds the second coming, and explains that In order to be, first we must [Si] how A.M.D. and Silicon bring sight in the context of this counterpart to Jupiter in the map that links elements to the list of planets that is highlighted by Ecclesiastes 9:11 and the "Lamp Stands" of Revelation 1:20.  The sight comes from lightning, Jupiter's weapon, but that lightning is truly "sight" of the contextually intricate and ordinate solution you see.  Jupiter's lightning also relates to electricity, and Silicon here takes the "A.D." of Sinbad, Anno Domini, and Adonai one step further and adds my middle initial to American Micro Devices.

 

Huh?  Earlier I sent an email that explained how Revelation 1:20 and the date of the George W. Bush quote above (1/20/2001) suggested a mystery of "7 stars and 7 lamp stands."  The book (in progress) containing this explanation is here: Behold, The Burning Bush.
  

I've seen through a sort of vision how each of our planets are actually the stars, something highlighted Biblically by the notion that Venus is the bright morning star.  Each of the planets has a very specific element tied to it, for Mercury it's obvious; and at the other end too... Uranus and uranium tie together without much controversy.

 

To solve the elements for the planets in the middle, though, you have to really know me.  In this case the tie is over the connection between the number 14 and 5 which I personally relate by way of my initials (AD) and the number of the "day of creation" I associate with my ... birth.  Five has always been my number, and if I can pull movies out of thin air to confirm things (like The Fifth Element) I might as well mention Short Circuit here, completely with it's named reference to "Johnny" (for Jesus) and being "alive."   You could also look at your hand, and see another connection between 14 and 5, one that brings up another good "AD" example, the word for hand in Hebrew, YAD.  That's "why AD?" To see!
  

Truly what I see being exposed here is proof that there is angelic or outside control over our culture, through the well placed examples in our movies (and plays) all the way from Mila Jovovich's messianic role in The Fith Element to Shakespeare's question, which I for one have always wondered about when I think about this favorite movie.

A.D. comes up in more interesting places.  The Hebrew name meaning "Lord God" is **Adonai** and the period of time that comes right before Christmas, you know when Adam is trying to get noticed and nobody is listening? Oh right, **ADvent.**
  

Then there's the Greek god, **Adonis;** which might highlight that there is a clear language within words, a "Cyper" if you will that links myths and names together in a sort of "Matrix" across the globe and through time.  If **Adonai** is "AD on Artificial Intelligence" (which makes logical sense as a reason for Lord Christ's being) then **Adonis** must be "me" on "Information Systems."   No wait,
"I'm Single" makes much more sense in the context of the story.

 

This is a dating site, right?

#ADvent
Being hidden from the world has been difficult for me, you can imagine I'd vent nearly every Christmas... waiting to be able to deliver a message that I know the world needs to hear.  More than that, they need it to come from Christ himself, even if they don't really want him to exist.  I'm sure to disappoint those seeking perfection, or even someone that's nice all the time; but not delivering the world changing message is probably a bigger problem for me.  Hopefully you won't hate me as much as the last guy.

#The Fall of the Anti-Christ(s)
It appears that a number of historical figures have references to "Adam and Venus," figures who are commonly described as Anti-Christs.  It appears that our history has been used as a sort of storage device, chronicling the past mistakes of the figure designed to bring great change to our world, the messiah.  All three listed below have references within their names to either me, salt, or the inintial "JC."  All three were responsible for the destruction of liberty, fascism, a plebescite turned dictatorship, and Caesar riding into Rome to turn a Republic into the Empire.  More than historical records of what could very well be "futures past," they are serious warnings both me and the world.  Christ is not meant to be a king, and never was.  

Look to Saturn's championship of the people, and the Roman God's love for what is a decidedly Athenian idean of the power of the people for clues as to why Arthur and his Round Table are much better patterns for the Second Coming than "Lord V**ad**er."  I mean Jesus.

##ADolf and Eva
If Adonai is "Artificial Intelligence" and Adonis is "I'm Single" then Adolf is "Adam Dobrin on light fails.*  The names of Adolf and Eva also bear a striking resemblance to Adam and Eve in Eden, it seems obvious that they are intended to be mirrors of a "coming of Christ" gone wrong, literally written in our history.  

##***Na*-pole-on** the "Salt of the Earth"
###Herod and Herbert
Like Amish and Iran, this these two names are "pronoun-accusations."  The king at the time of the birth of Christ, Herod (perhaps a reference to George H.W. Bush) suggest that Christ *is the Rod* rather than weilding it.  This imagery, of being the hammer of thor, applies well in the context of Zeus--a lightning rod that is being used to focus the introduction of "Biblical light."
