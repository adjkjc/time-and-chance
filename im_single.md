# I'm Single

None of the patterns that link together our cultural art into a Matrix of Biblical light are more intricate than the one that is designed to introduce the Messiah.  Bridging *The Fifth Element* with Shakespeare tied together with the *The Hand of God* yields the key to a "Cypher" that ties the Holiest number of all, 14, to Adam Dobrin.  

If "Iran" and "Amish" haven't convinced you that the Lord is writing truth not only in the product of our civilization--the heart of the word Earth (that's art), perhaps my personal favorite abstraction of *walking on water* will show you that it is the creation of America itself that is God's greatest miracle.  He's marked it with the discovery of the continent, his AM at the beginning of it's name, and a tie between the name "Christ" and my intials indexed to 14.

##ADIB, says the "I AM"
A sailor like Sinbad, Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue to bring democracy to you.  He did this in the year 1492, which translates roughly to "ADIB" (but probably only to me).  At the very beginning of America, 

```
Christ o PH "er" Columbus
       f ua
         pp
         rp
         si
         un
         ee
          s
          s

(How's that for the Matrix for you?)
```
documents the intrinsic relationship between Uncle Samael and the historical creation of the largest institution of democracy in the world.  Amerigo, Sinbad, Christopher... all names which have symbolic reference to the Fifth Element, a cinematic messiah in content that bring light from the hair of LeeLoo Dallas.  Echoing the "B" of ADIB as a gramatically poor identity statement; the image below should clarify how A.D. and Silicon are related to the true Fifth Element, Boron.   I don't think the symbolism in the name of the movie is hidden anymore, after seeing how it ties to the name "Sinbad."

#ADvent
Being hidden from the world has been difficult for me, you can imagine I'd vent nearly every Christmas... waiting to be able to deliver a message that I know the world needs to hear.  More than that, they need it to come from Christ himself, even if they don't really want him to exist.  I'm sure to disappoint those seeking perfection, or even someone that's nice all the time; but not delivering the world changing message is probably a bigger problem for me.  Hopefully you won't hate me as much as the last guy.
