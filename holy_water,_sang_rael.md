# Holy Water, Sang Rael

```
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness 
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God       SHE KIN AH   
moved upon the face of the waters.                         ----------

And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
