# Holy Water, Sang Rael

```
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness 
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God       SHE KIN AH   
moved upon the face of the waters.                         ----------
                                                           EVE RY ONE
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

Genesis 1:1-3

##Holy Water is *people*
This is a baptism, or at least what that concept metaphorically refers to, it's a shock with cold *water*, seeing that something so obvious has been hidden from the world *and absolutely nobody noticed.*  Like Soy*lent* Green, a cinematic tool to understand how water is people, Biblically, references to the sea, and *walking on people* (wow) are both clear as clues.  Christ walks on people to deliver this Revelation, it is my will--and His--to ensure that we do not lose the truth or our freedom.  There is no choice, hence, *walking on water.*  
```
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together 
of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

Gensis 1:10

You should have read about Ground, Earth, and **Adam**ah in [*The Tower of Babel*](https://adjkjc.gitbooks.io/time-and-chance/content/the_tower_of_babel.html).

From the S E A of Eden, to the multitude of Revelation.

Taylor Momsen sings that "everyone must be saved."  There is a huge secret message in the Bible, one that literally spans from Eden in Genesis to the multitude in Revelation.  Its about the "sea" short for Seth,Eve,Adam in the beginning, and expanding.  Holy water is people is the beginning of the Holy Grail.  

```
The dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast 
coming out of the sea.

Revelation 13

Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the 
seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the
four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the 
sea: 3 â€œDo not harm the land or the sea or the trees ...

After this I looked, and there before me was a 
great multitude that no one could count, from 
every nation, tribe, people and language, 
standing before the throne and before the Lamb.

Revelation 7

He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land.

Revelation 10
```

And so, walking on water, the Lamb gives you a little scroll.


Add in the Plague of Water to Blood (from Exodus, a "Blessing in Disguise"), and the multitude turns to the family of Christ.  I call this message the Holy Grail, like the cup that contains Jesus' blood.  The cup is the Earth, when you see moving the "h" to the beginning makes it Heart.. a Heart filled with blood.  

I have a message to Taylor, **you're right** might you see how you can be the match that lights Jim Morrison's fire.

That's "More, I son.."  

I mentioned her song, Absolution or Burn I can't remember.. where she says she "can't find her door" links to another message of Christ.   The Iron Rod read backwards is tied to the band The Doors; named after gateways to Heaven that are secretly prophesied to come .... soon.  I haven't seen mine either, but the message of the Rod is that it is juxtaposed to Aarons "let my people go" through the periodic table symbol for Iron..

###Doors, ***F***or ***e***veryone.  

The story goes that I said Jesus couldn't exist, because he would *never **rule** for a thousand years with an Iron Rod*.  Being born in America, as Queen sings "here we are, born to be Kings" I changed my mind about the rod, when it became a key to the Doors.
