# Holy Water, Sang Rael

```
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness 
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God       SHE KIN AH   
moved upon the face of the waters.                         ----------

And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

Genesis 1:1-3

From the S E A of Eden, to the multitude of Revelation.

Taylor Momsen sings that "everyone must be saved."  There is a huge secret message in the Bible, one that literally spans from Eden in Genesis to the multitude in Revelation.  Its about the "sea" short for Seth,Eve,Adam in the beginning, and expanding.  Holy water is people is the beginning of the Holy Grail.  

Add in the Plague of Water to Blood (from Exodus, a "Blessing in Disguise"), and the multitude turns to the family of Christ.  I call this message the Holy Grail, like the cup that contains Jesus' blood.  The cup is the Earth, when you see moving the "h" to the beginning makes it Heart.. a Heart filled with blood.  

I have a message to Taylor, **you're right** might you see how you can be the match that lights Jim Morrison's fire.

That's "More, I son.."  

I mentioned her song, Absolution or Burn I can't remember.. where she says she "can't find her door" links to another message of Christ.   The Iron Rod read backwards is tied to the band The Doors; named after gateways to Heaven that are secretly prophesied to come .... soon.  I haven't seen mine either, but the message of the Rod is that it is juxtaposed to Aarons "let my people go" through the periodic table symbol for Iron..

###Doors, ***F***or ***e***veryone.  

The story goes that I said Jesus couldn't exist, because he would *never **rule** for a thousand years with an Iron Rod*.  Being born in America, as Queen sings "here we are, born to be Kings" I changed my mind about the rod, when it became a key to the Doors.
