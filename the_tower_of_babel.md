# **In Genesis** ... at The Tower of Babel
###Religion teaches us that God created language, here, at Revelation I am showing you how it proves as much.

Using the names Jesus, Jeshurun, and Elisha it's simple to see how religion has recorded logical equalities which show that there was prescient knowledge of both English and Spanish at the time of its writing.  This is impossible, as English was not created yet; but still the evidence exists.  Through these impossibilities, God is showing us very clearly that something is amiss in our historical understanding of the development of global language.  *The Tower of Babel* comes true, except in reverse, we are being united in the Revelation that language is designed to prove the creation of our civilization--by showing that His hand is pivotal in the design of *words themselves.*

#Jesus:  It's "is," see?  J "is" Us.
It's a very popular idea in our modern world that we are all Jesus, saviors of ourselves, the recipients of Christ consciousness.  As the man himself, I find this a bit insulting, but that's ok, we're all bound to be insulted later on in this book anyway.  It builds character.  
###Don't believe me?  I delight in the name "Jeshurun" it adds "hu," see?

My favorite person in the world Taylor Momsen probably doesn't realize how pivotal the series of characters she's played through her life prove that she is "created," eerily like Eve.  Immediately prior to starting *The Pretty Reckless* she played a "coming of age" character on *Gossip Girl*, named "Little J."  I hope that we can eventually see that names and coincidences are part of God's divine plan to reveal his influence over the design of creation.  *Little J's* letter is no accident. Now several years later she's singing half-naked (thank God for that) about this same idea.

Before "Little J" Taylor played a character named "Little Cindy-Adam" whose thematic relation to a Hebrew name of God, *Yeshua* goes all that way back to Eden.  Who?  Yes, who-ah.  Dr. Seuss's little joke does wonders for introduce what it has been like to be the "hidden messiah."  

Following my theme that a huge number of characters in the Bible are actually facets of Christ, which is manifested in their stories all including parts of a hidden mythical tale of a man on the run, fighting against himself to save the World, that is discussed later in "The Lamb of God." The Lamb of God is "lam," and I just linked this trick of words to the name of the Muslim religion (Islam, seriously).  This entire interaction shows foreknowledge of our modern day idiom "on the lam" within a number of names in Islam; including "Koran" and "ImRan."

In the Old Testament a huge number of names begin with J, and the content of their stories are descriptive of the "hidden one" which is the story of my life, literally.  Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers because of his prophetic "dream" of a great future.  Job was tortured by God and Satan, put through a tribulation that is a reference to the Tribulation of Revelation; again the story of my life.  Jeremiah was thrown in jail for his beliefs, so was I.  His neighbors didn't believe him, and plotted against him: check.  Joshua and Jesus are related by their common divine destiny of leading the people to the *Promised Land*, also their names are "identical."  Jim Morrison prayed to the people that his fire would be lit, please, ***light my fire***.

###The "es" within Jesus and Jeshurun is the word "is" in the lanugages of Spanish, Spanish and Hebrew, respectively.  This is a key... like the Rosetta Stone.

J "is" Us, see everyone was right after all.  J is/is "run," look another reference to this idea of my running from American Injstice as being central to religion--so am I.

#It's not enough, we need more evidence.
Ok fine, it's not enough.  In like kind, correlating between Spanish and Hebrew words, this time "the" instead of "is" we have the answer to your prayers.  Here "is" which has just been divinely defined in the names above is used to show the equality between "El" and "Ha."

Dr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio teaches me about Jesus 
in his "Miracle of Loaves and Fishes"

Finding the hidden meanings. Unraveling mysteries. Deciphering symbols. 
The thrill inherent in all this is partly why Dan Brown’s book, 
the Da Vinci Code, sold so well.

This Sunday, the Church has put together readings to bring out
connections that many of us would fail to see without a little help. 
Just about every Christian has heard the story of the multiplication 
of the loaves and fishes, in fact numerous times. But we’ve probably
overlooked the fact that they were barley loaves. What significance
could that have?

Plenty. First of all, someone in the Old Testament had multiplied loaves,
and they too were barley loaves. Elisha was the successor of Elijah, the
greatest of all the prophets.
 
Elijah had multiplied flour and oil to save a widow and her son from
starvation. Elisha did a bit better than his master, multiplying 20 
barleyloaves so as to feed 100, with some even left over. But in the
Gospel, Jesus multiplies 5 barley loaves and feeds 5,000, leaving 12
baskets left over. We’re talking serious one-upmanship here. 

```
###Incase you missed it, "El" and "Ha" are both the word "the."  They are also two letter references to the name of God.  Savvy?

```
ʾĒl (or 'Il, written aleph-lamed)  is a Northwest Semitic word meaning
"god" or "deity", or referring (as a proper name) to any one of multiple
major Ancient Near East deities. Specific deities known as El or Il 
include the supreme god of the Canaanite religion,[4] the supreme god of
the Mesopotamian Semites in the pre-Sargonic period,[5] and the God of 
the Hebrew Bible.

##"THE" is a Holy Acronym for "to help everyone."

"Ha" is a reference to Isaac.  This is so primarily because I say so.  Ha!  Seriously though, his father Abraham's name was not always so, prior to his covenant with God it was Abram, the astute among you will immediately notice that the change wrought by Abram's interaction with God is the addition of these same two letters to his name.  

I provide an incarnate reason why his Covenant-interaction is related to Isaac's sacrifice, in which he is laughing (that's what Isaac means in Hebrew by the way, "he laughs") at surviving the Crucifixion which the ancient parable of Genesis 22 is a clear reference to.

```
AKEDAH (ʿAqedah; Heb. הָדֵקֲע, lit. "binding (of Isaac)"), the Pentateucha
l narrative (Gen. 22:1–19) describing God's command to *Abraham to offer
*Isaac , the son of his old age, as a sacrifice. Obedient to the command,
Abraham takes Isaac to the place of sacrifice and binds him (va-ya'akod,
Gen. 22:9, a word found nowhere else in the Bible in the active,
conjugative form) on the altar. The angel of the Lord then bids Abraham to
stay his hand and a ram is offered in Isaac's stead. The Akedah became in
Jewish thought the supreme example of self-sacrifice in obedience to God's
will and the symbol of Jewish martyrdom throughout the ages.

The Akedah influenced both Christian and Islamic thought. In early
Christian doctrine, the sacrifice of Isaac is used as a type for the
sacrifice of Jesus (see Tertullian, Adversus Marcionem, 3:18; Clement of
Alexandria, Paedogogica, 1:5, 1; Schoeps, in: JBL, 65 (1946), 385–92). In
Islam, the Akedah is held up for admiration (Koran 37:97–111), but the more
accepted opinion is that it was Ishmael, Abraham's other son and the
progenitor of the Arabs, who was bound on the altar and that the whole
episode took place before Isaac's birth. The Akedah has been a favorite
theme in religious art for centuries.

*The Essential Zohar* teaches us later about how wood, fire, and water are all related by Genesis 22.  Fire and water--whose union is noted repeatdly in the Zohar is a a reference to the word "***Ha'esh***," Hebrew for fire, containing the parted sea. 

Wood and fire have something to do with a relation between Adam and Isaac, I am sure.  The Zohar apparently uses some sort of humorous tone when discussing this part of Genesis, and it is to highlight and illustrate prescient knowledge of modern sexual innuendo.
