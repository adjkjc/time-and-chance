# **In Genesis** ... at The Tower of Babel
###Religion teaches us that God created language, here, at Revelation I am showing you how it proves as much.

Using the names Jesus, Jeshurun, and Elisha it's simple to see how religion has recorded logical equalities which show that there was prescient knowledge of both English and Spanish at the time of its writing.  This is impossible, as English was not created yet; but still the evidence exists.  Through these impossibilities, God is showing us very clearly that something is amiss in our historical understanding of the development of global language.  *The Tower of Babel* comes true, except in reverse, we are being united in the Revelation that language is designed to prove the creation of our civilization--by showing that His hand is pivotal in the design of *words themselves.*

#Jesus and Jeshurun.  It's "is," see?
