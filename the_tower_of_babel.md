# **In Genesis** ... at The Tower of Babel
###Religion teaches us that God created language, here, at Revelation I am showing you how it proves as much.

Using the names Jesus, Jeshurun, and Elisha it's simple to see how religion has recorded logical equalities which show that there was prescient knowledge of both English and Spanish at the time of its writing.  This is impossible, as English was not created yet; but still the evidence exists.  Through these impossibilities, God is showing us very clearly that something is amiss in our historical understanding of the development of global language.  *The Tower of Babel* comes true, except in reverse, we are being united in the Revelation that language is designed to prove the creation of our civilization--by showing that His hand is pivotal in the design of *words themselves.*

#Jesus and Jeshurun.  It's "is," see?
It's a very popular idea in our modern world that we are all Jesus, saviors of ourselves, the recipients of Christ consciousness.  As the man himself, I find this a bit insulting, but that's ok, we're all bound to be insulted later on in this book anyway.  It builds character.  My favorite person in the world Taylor Momsen probably doesn't realize how pivotal the series of characters she's played through her life prove that she is "created," eerily like Eve.  Immediately prior to starting *The Pretty Reckless* she played a "coming of age" character on *Gossip Girl*, named "Little J."  I hope that we can eventually see that names and coincidences are part of God's divine plan to reveal his influence over the design of creation.  *Little J's* letter is no accident. Now several years later she's singing half-naked (thank God for that) about this same idea.

Following my theme that a huge number of characters in the Bible are actually facets of Christ, which is manifested in their stories all including parts of a hidden mythical tale of a man on the run, fighting against himself to save the World, that is discussed later in "The Lamb of God." The Lamb of God is "lam," and I just linked this trick of words to the name of the Muslim religion (Islam, seriously).  This entire interaction shows foreknowledge of our modern day idiom "on the lam" within a number of names in Islam; including "Koran" and "ImRan."

In the Old Testament a huge number of names begin with J, and the content of their stories are descriptive of the "hidden one" which is the story of my life, literally.  Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers because of his prophetic "dream" of a great future.  Job was tortured by God and Satan, put through a tribulation that is a reference to the Tribulation of Revelation; again the story of my life.  Jeremiah was thrown in jail for his beliefs, so was I.  His neighbors didn't believe him, and plotted against him: check.  Joshua and Jesus are related by their common divine destiny of leading the people to the *Promised Land*, also their names are "identical."  Jim Morrison prayed to the people that his fire would be lit, please, ***light my fire***.

###The "es" within Jesus and Jeshurun is the word "is" in the lanugages of Spanish, Spanish and Hebrew, respectively.  This is a key... like the Rosetta Stone.

Say they want to know who did it
But the answer's really us see

J "is" Us, see everyone was right after all.  J is/is "run," look another reference to this idea of my running from American Injstice as being central to religion--so am I.

#It's not enough, we need more evidence.
Ok fine, it's not enough.  In like kind, correlating between Spanish and Hebrew words, this time "the" instead of "is" we have the answer to your prayers.  Here "is" which has just been divinely defined in the names above is used to show the equality between "El" and "Ha."

Dr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio teaches me about Jesus 
in "Miracle of Loaves and Fishes"

Finding the hidden meanings. Unraveling mysteries. Deciphering symbols. 
The thrill inherent in all this is partly why Dan Brown’s book, 
the Da Vinci Code, sold so well.

This Sunday, the Church has put together readings to bring out
connections that many of us would fail to see without a little help. 
Just about every Christian has heard the story of the multiplication 
of the loaves and fishes, in fact numerous times. But we’ve probably
overlooked the fact that they were barley loaves. What significance
could that have?

Plenty. First of all, someone in the Old Testament had multiplied loaves,
and they too were barley loaves. Elisha was the successor of Elijah, the
greatest of all the prophets.
 
Elijah had multiplied flour and oil to save a widow and her son from
starvation. Elisha did a bit better than his master, multiplying 20 
barleyloaves so as to feed 100, with some even left over. But in the
Gospel, Jesus multiplies 5 barley loaves and feeds 5,000, leaving 12
baskets left over. We’re talking serious one-upmanship here. 

```
###Incase you missed it, "El" and "Ha" are both the word "the."  They are also two letter references to the name of God.  Savvy?
