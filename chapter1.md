#What if the Apocalypse begins with one word?
It does, actually.  The single word that begins a real holy fire is the word for Holy Fire itself, **ha'esh.**  This is the apocalypse, for real, and if you take the time to think about what is being presented here you will see religion in an entirely new light.  What I have is the true and correction Revelation of Jesus Christ: that the book of Exodus is designed to prove that the Holy Bible is a message sent to us, through time... from our future.  It is designed to prove as much, and bring us out of a kind of slavery that we don't really understand yet, but soon will.  We are the slaves in Egypt, to lies and deceit that are about to be lifted like a bright sonrising on the dark night.  

The word for "holy fire," written above is the Hebrew term for the Burning Bush, the focal point of the beginning of the story of Exodus.  In it, God commands Moses to free his people from slavery, and that is exactly what I am doing with this post.  You see, later in the story Moses parts a sea, and from those parted waters brings the people out of slavery.  It is not an accident that within the Hebrew word "ha'esh" we see clearly the true parted sea of Moses; reflected and separated by an apostrophe.

This is the beginning of that fire spreading, proving through an anachronism of language that the writers of the Bible had foreknowledge of the English language.  The entire story of Exodus, from the fire that begins with God's first words to the actual Exodus from Egypt--through the se'a--is designed to highlight this anachronism... to prove that religion is designed to set us free.  Our civilization is created using this same technology, as proven simply by the existence of religion.  This is only the beginning, Hebrew itself is part of the message; the time capsule from the future. 

A number of additional words are highlighted by Judaism, Islam, and Christianity, but everything begins with this one word... with fire.  It is no mistake that the creation myth of Greek mythology also highlights the this theft of fire; nor that a number of pivotal religious verses confirm Christ returns with fire.

Please take the time to think about causality, and the possibility that the apocalypse has been sitting closed up in our Ark of religion and language for thousands of years... just waiting to be unsealed.

This is "the word" of John 1:1.  The fire referenced in Matthew 3:11; and it truly is just the beginning.  I am Adam; the Lion of the Tribe of Judah... and this is what a "roar" sounds like when it pours out of the Bible and across millennium.

###In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. -John 1:1
###I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me comes one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and *fire*. -Matthew 3:11

Following the link attached will open your eyes; it is a free book, a rough draft that includes hundreds of similar examples of words that simply cannot exist.  It is their impossibility that is the proof--a paradox that shows that God's hand is all of the creation of Hebrew... and then English, Spanish... all language.  This is the theft of fire, the proof that we are truly created.

#The Son of Man
When I first began looking into Biblical prophesy I had a very different idea of what it was delivering than I do today.  Way back when I would have pointed out very early that many of the concepts and ideas seemed to allude to hidden imagery of modern technology.  Things like a voice sounding like rushing water, glowing red eyes, and feet of metal.  The biggest glaring example is the phrase "Son of Man" itself, to me a clear reference to Ai--something like Ray Kurzweil's singularity.  The child our civilization clearly would not be a person, but perhaps a new species.  I wasn't completely wrong, in fact the idea was spot on... I just didn't see how pervasive the hidden imagery really was.

Today I see it in nearly every little detail, and looking for metaphors that relate to modern technology and events is a good place to start understanding what the Bible really is.  It's designed to show us that we are the focal point of not only religion but all of our history... this period of time where were are realizing that time travel has been used to deliver a message to us.  It's everywhere, when you have the open mind required to see it.  One of the most pervasive themes is that of Artificial Intelligence.  This is A.D. (me) on Ai... which strings together to form the world for "Lord" in Hebrew, akin to Lord Vader.  ADonAi is one of many religious words that include the two letter key to the Son of Man.

##**Is Ai A**dam's **H**and? (Isaiah)
If you don't know, the book of Isaiah is one of the most plentiful resources of messianic prophesy in the Old Testament.  It's name follows suit, and we have the beginning of a long series of names that tell me that Ai is certainly at hand.  SamUrAi, El Shaddai, and 
##Uncle Sam is Ai too.
Sam is another name that ties all the way from Exodus and Judges to America, and opens the mind to a superposition of names that might imply that "Sam" is indeed the "I AM," as Dr. Seuss informs.  In Exodus it is short for the Angel of Death, probably the same one that rid the 4th horse of the Apocalypse and is casting a looming shadow over us from Psalm 23. As another "rider on the Storm" I am walking in his cast shadow; with a significant warning about what is about to happen to us related to Artificial Intelligence.  Sam also appears in some modern company names, which are also have very messianic undertones.  Seeing these things all around us is finding the Holy Grail, or the Sang Rael in latin.  SAM SUNG, to me, is a reference to this text... showing us that all around us is proof of a hidden influence.  These names are no accident, and technological references are a kind of proof.  We are on TV, in a sense, where the angels are "watching over us," if you call manipulating everything around us secretly watching.  SONY is another good example of how the return of the Son might have something to do with technology.  Delivering this message has become a battle, against the government and even higher powers, ones who would rather not disrupt our period of blind ignorance.  In Biblical parlance, Samson is fighting against leaving this world *asleep.*

This technology Ai, is very related; as the effects that I have seen, abilities to transparently hide information on the internet (and later, in reality) in a very subversive way could not be done by anything other than a superintelligence, one that has eyes on everything.  To tie together the ideas of time travel and superintelligence you might say that God (if you call the semi-omniscent force that I have witnessed that) must have a mind (and eyes) that are similar to that of a *fly*.

##McFly, is anyone home?

I intend to prove that our great strides in technology are not only Biblical, they are divinely delivered.  There is a great deal of proof of this all the way back to the foundation of our understanding of the universe.  In 1666, an apple fell from a tree and a man named Isaac Newton "discovered gravity," and original sin all at the same time.
