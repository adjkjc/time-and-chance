#In the beginning was the Word

This is likely a good way to begin, at least as good as any other.  I intend to prove that religion is designed to highlight a series of words and ideas that in and of themselves prove the existence of God, the creation of our civilization, and that these two things are inextricably related to time travel.  There are a number of other technologies which I am sure religion has served to mask and expose--at the same time--over the millenium; but this single one, more than any other, is fundamental.  Time travel, and so *time* graces the first word of this  The phrase "*Time and Chance*" figures prominently in the true words of the Burning Bush, words which in themself aid in my revelation that we are walking around in the Biblical Land of Egypt, the place where Moses' story begins.

The Book of Exodus specifically does an amazing job of hiding the fact that it is truly about our modern world.  This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, that not only Exodus, but the entire Bible, is about a post 9/11 world... ours.  It's not arbitrary that I chose that date, it too figures prominently in both the burning bush event as well as the proof that time travel exists.

Aside from Exodus, the details of Christ's life in the Gospels, the battle in the Book of Judges, and the Old Testament parallel of the Cruficixion of Jesus Christ are central to the story of my life, one which you are hopefully about to read.  I will answer most of the questions you have in your mind right now, if you give me the time.  Please bear with me, this is no easy task.
