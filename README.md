#In the beginning was the Word

This is likely a good way to begin, at least as good as any other.  I intend to prove that religion is designed to highlight a series of words and ideas that in and of themselves prove the existence of God, the creation of our civilization, and that these two things are inextricably related to time travel.  There are a number of other technologies which I am sure religion has served to mask and expose--at the same time--over the millenium; but this single one, more than any other, is fundamental.  Time travel, and so *time* graces the first word of this  The phrase "*Time and Chance*" figures prominently in the true words of the Burning Bush, words which in themself aid in my revelation that we are walking around in the Biblical Land of Egypt, the place where Moses' story begins.

The Book of Exodus specifically does an amazing job of hiding the fact that it is truly about our modern world.  This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, that not only Exodus, but the entire Bible, is about a post 9/11 world... ours.  It's not arbitrary that I chose that date, it too figures prominently in both the burning bush event as well as the proof that time travel exists.

Aside from Exodus, the details of Christ's life in the Gospels, the battle in the Book of Judges, and the Old Testament parallel of the Cruficixion of Jesus Christ are central to the story of my life, one which you are hopefully about to read.  I will answer most of the questions you have in your mind right now, if you give me the time.  Please bear with me, this is no easy task.

##My name is Adam Marshall Dobrin

My first name might remind you of a cartoon character in Eden, a naked guy that was ashamed of eating an apple.  The real Adam, the author of this book, will be quick to point out that his Biblical counterpart in reality is Isaac.  Whether you stuck with the theme and think I'm talking about the son of Abraham... or went way out in left field and thought of Sir Isaac Newton, we'll you'd be right.  You see in keeping with the earlier stated theme; these are all metaphorical representations of the same character.  

Isaac's story of being nearly sacrificed as a burnt offering is especially important to me, however, as it is this story which unifies the 3 Patriarchal religions under one umbrella of fire and death... through nothing short of a few letters.  It's the first three letters of Isaac which tie him, via names, to Jesus Christ... through the Muslim rendition of his name, Isa.  It's not as superficial as that, but rather the very substantial unification through the meaning of their respective near death experiences.  Isaac's near sacrifice is another take on the story of Jesus' Crucifixion, and it is the fact that not many people make this connection that makes it stand out ever so brightly to me.

Even fewer people, I'm sure, connect these two stories to the fall of Adam in Eden; and it is this addition that is so fundamental that I am boldly declaring it required to see these three stories as different aspects of the same events in order to have any real understanding of religion whatsoever.

Had you lept to the real hisorical stor of Isaac Newton, oh you thought I forgot, you would be seeing yet another name key that links Adam's fall... and his Apple.. to Isaac.  This introduction to  a hidden language that hides whole multilingual sentinces within names asks you the question: are you "New to n?"

Had you not been "new," you would almost cetainly already know that "what goes up, must come down," and that whole tale compressed as a story in a glyph for one single letter of the English alphabet: the n.  This letter also compreses something else supremely important t the apocalypse: my initials.

#its the "n" of word as we know it.
