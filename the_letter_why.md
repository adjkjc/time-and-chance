# The Letter Why

Born on the 8th of December, Yankee Doodle should say; as this is the true birthday of the Messiah... the day of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.  It is part of a great number of details of my life that are alluded to in religion, in the customs that surround the Bible; which has left so much direct reference to me that its clearly designed to point me out, to the world.

```
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face, what would it look like
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus

In what is a "joke" that correlates the word "messiah" to an immaculate cleanliness that can only come from the clean slate of new birth; this song joins the growing body of proof that links my life's experience to the angelic song that is surrounding us.  The theme of Joan of Arcadia, that God speaks through people is made even clearer by actually believing it.  It is no mistake that I am "a slob," and the mess of my life is part of the solution to our worlds problems.  Through me, we will be saved.
