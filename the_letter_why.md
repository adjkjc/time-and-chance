# The Letter Why

Born on the 8th of December, Yankee Doodle should say; as this is the true birthday of the Messiah... the day of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.  It is part of a great number of details of my life that are alluded to in religion, in the customs that surround the Bible; which has left so much direct reference to me that its clearly designed to point me out, to the world.

```
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face, what would it look like
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus

In what is a "joke" that correlates the word "messiah" to an immaculate cleanliness that can only come from the clean slate of new birth; this song joins the growing body of proof that links my life's experience to the angelic song that is surrounding us.  The theme of Joan of Arcadia, that God speaks through people is made even clearer by actually believing it.  It is no mistake that I am "a slob," and the mess of my life is part of the solution to our worlds problems.  Through me, we will be saved.

DOB-R-IN (that's: Date of Birth, our 'In') my last name is not arbitrarily containing the acronym for date of birth, which clearly links 12/8/1980 to the word "messiah."  It is the first of many names that will show a divine hand that has pre-written our world and marked its influence and existence.  My mother's maiden name, Gerson, fills another gap; showing that in my names we have the hidden "sky" and the hidden "son."  Dobrin is shortened from Dobrinsky, and these two words are references to Uranus, God of the Sky, and Christ.

Just off Sunrise Blvd, and down the street from Sunset Strip; the story of my life quickly moved from perfect to a mess.  I was born in family whose given names are direct pointers to Eden.  Adam, Melissa Eve, and Seth make up a part of the true "First Family," a trinity whose initials make up the word "sea," an early clue that our story will be likening these microcosmic abstractions in Eden to the ideas of family and the multitude once we make it through the book all the way to Revelation.  The sea is people, and when we get all the way to Christmas the multitude family.

The hidden connections between languages, specifically Spanish and English through is something that is highlighted repeatedly in what will become obviously an extension of religion.  *The Taming of the Shrew* is an allusion to Spanglishrew, a combination of Spanish, English, and Hebrew that marks a linguistic key to a prescient and divine hand in the construction of all of our language.  It is the Tower of Babel in reverse, proving that the fire of Prometheus is actually language, and through a number of examples which equate the meaning of a number of like-meaning words, God shows that their connections were known about at the time of the writing of the Torah.
