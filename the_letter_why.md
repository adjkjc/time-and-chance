# The Letter Why
![](FLUXXCAPIMG_2422.jpg)

The things in this chapter are what I call "superficial evidence," they are names and words that are probably boring; but yet confirm to me that I have been pre-selected, destined from before my birth to be the messiah.  A number of the examples on this page fulfill Biblical prophesy, and are literal teaching of Christ spoken about in the New Testament.  My twists are the intended original intent, which serves as a pointer to these examples which have real useful meaning, as well as serving as more proof that our languages are designed in order to reveal this truth now.

Throughout this book, you will find interesting tidbits of knowledge, a fresh take on old stories; tying them together in unique and original ways... and most importantly discussing how they relate to us today, they are in fact written for us, and about us.

This is evidenced by the Matrix-like links between Biblical themes and modern people, places, things, and ideas.  I am simply pointing out these links, it is Biblical that they exist--the purpose of the Bible as a key is to show us very specifically that we are the focus of the Apocalypse.

#It's a Hoot, and Y "Plenty of Fish"
The band and front singer for Hooty and the Blowfish will deny any involvement in the use of their name as the actual post-creation key for the word "HOLY."  The name appears to have not been chosen in correlation to the ancient description of God, and yet I am very sure that this too is proof that divine inspiration is responsible for the selection.  This is how "inspiration" is proved, by not having it be overtly known by those inspired... and then later making it very obvious that there is infact a hidden meaning and purpose for the 'information transfer' in question.  Blowfish is an answer to the cinematic movie *Fisher King*, which in turn is related to the moniker of Christ:  The Fisher of Men.

I see the movie title as a langolier question posed to me, Fish or King?  It uses "er" as a "logical or" whose answer should be self evident.  In this particular case, the answer will one day be obviously contrived; but for lets focus on "hooty."  This series of letters are representative of astrological symbols, and tell a story that ties together a number of Roman dieties.  The first letter, "h" is the symbol for Saturn; and it places first in these words because he is the God of travel.  Thus Saturn has jumped to the very beginning of our linear map of the evolution or progression of the divine character.

Much like the Fluxx Capacitor, I fell off a toilet (not really) and drew this picture, which keenly illustrates the relationship between the symbols for Saturn, Venus, Mars, Saggitarius... and why.  



###It is no mistake that El and the cross are unified across HOLY HOOTY and HOT.

#Y-its-Ha'CK (Isaac)
It might belong in "he laughs," for the laughter at CK, but this double entedre, which hides another connection to computing within the transliteration of Isaac's name is one of the best Y's around.  Why it's hack, laughter about Clark Kent.  Hidden no more, it seems.

#Yeast
#Yair
#Yetser
This Hebrew word means "formation," and is very much associated with creation.  It's one of the most profound examples of Spanglish I have ever seen, because it's meaning changes with addition of Latin and Y.  The change in meaning is akin to a transition from "imagined" to "created" with the addition of purpose.  This is coming from a perspective where we are as of yet to be created in reality, to fully exist; and in order to gain that achievement this word implies we must be told our "purpose."

```
From yet-ser,      
     yet to be; to "y et ser:"  
                  why and "to be."
```
Que sera sera.  This also bears a striking relationship to the Shakespearean question "To be, or not to be?" which is highlighted in the chapter titled *I'm Single*.

#YisRa-El
I am the light of the world, says Ra: God of the Son.  This homophone correlates the ancient Egyptian God to his counterpart in ancient Judaism, be sure Ra is El.  So sayeth the Oracle of Light, Larry Ellison's name and link to ElisHa.  Once more, Ha is the sun.

Born on the 8th of December, Yankee Doodle should say; as this is the true birthday of the Messiah... the day of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.  It is part of a great number of details of my life that are alluded to in religion, in the customs that surround the Bible; which has left so much direct reference to me that its clearly designed to point me out, to the world.

```
What if God was one of us
Just a slob like one of us
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

If God had a face, what would it look like
And would you want to see
If seeing meant that you would have to believe
In things like Heaven and in Jesus

In what is a "joke" that correlates the word "messiah" to an immaculate cleanliness that can only come from the clean slate of new birth; this song joins the growing body of proof that links my life's experience to the angelic song that is surrounding us.  The theme of Joan of Arcadia, that God speaks through people is made even clearer by actually believing it.  It is no mistake that I am "a slob," and the mess of my life is part of the solution to our worlds problems.  Through me, we will be saved.

DOB-R-IN (that's: Date of Birth, our 'In') my last name is not arbitrarily containing the acronym for date of birth, which clearly links 12/8/1980 to the word "messiah."  It is the first of many names that will show a divine hand that has pre-written our world and marked its influence and existence.  My mother's maiden name, Gerson, fills another gap; showing that in my names we have the hidden "sky" and the hidden "son."  Dobrin is shortened from Dobrinsky, and these two words are references to Uranus, God of the Sky, and Christ.

Just off Sunrise Blvd, and down the street from Sunset Strip; the story of my life quickly moved from perfect to a mess.  These streets, named before I was born, are only literal blocks away from where I spent most of my life.  Their names are references to the Biblical ideas of night and day, and herald the "son rise," the dawning that ends the Dark Plague of Egypt and brings our civilization out of the night and into the light... of the Son.  

I was born in family whose given names are direct pointers to Eden.  Adam, Melissa Eve, and Seth make up a part of the true "First Family," a trinity whose initials make up the word "sea," an early clue that our story will be likening these microcosmic abstractions in Eden to the ideas of family and the multitude once we make it through the book all the way to Revelation.  The sea is people, and when we get all the way to Christmas the multitude family.

The hidden connections between languages, specifically Spanish and English through is something that is highlighted repeatedly in what will become obviously an extension of religion.  *The Taming of the Shrew* is an allusion to Span-glish-rew, a combination of Spanish, English, and Hebrew that marks a linguistic key to a prescient and divine hand in the construction of all of our language.  It is the Tower of Babel in reverse, proving that the fire of Prometheus is actually language, and through a number of examples which equate the meaning of a number of like-meaning words, God shows that their connections were known about at the time of the writing of the Torah.
