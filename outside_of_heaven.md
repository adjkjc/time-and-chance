# Outside of Heaven

In The Pretty Reckless' song "Absolution" Taylor sings that we are *"outside of Heaven, but I could be wrong."* Personally I think she is wrong, that we are in Heaven as the Lord's prayer (or at least an alternative reading of it) indicates.

```
Our father ((who is)) art of Heaven
Hallowed be ((my)) name
((My Eden)) come
On Earth as it is in Heaven.

                                        The Lord's Prayer & ((ish))
                                        
                                        
Dear boy what are you running from
The answer you will find in your grave

Boys on the outside of heaven
But I could be wrong

The Prett Reckless, "Absolution"
```

This question, of whether or not we are actually *in* Heaven relates to Virtual Reality, and whether or not Eden's Garden is a reference to a virtual place, where we believe we are in reality... the "progenitor Universe" as Jacob always says; or inside of a game like place, designed to build heaven, colonize the Universe, all using the magic available from being in a computer generated place.

It's an important question, one which I do not know the answer to, but I believe the word "yetser" for formation in Hebrew and *Ender's Game* by Or**son** Scott Card indicates we are currently in a Heaven-like place.. only without the social structure that a true utoptia would have.  Ender's Game, if he is a messianic figure, might indicate that once we have achieved this leap to a better society, we will be "written in reality," as I have thought since learning of this question.
