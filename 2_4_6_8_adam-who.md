##What goes up must come down?

```
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven 
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and 
for seasons, and for days, and years:

Genesis: 1:AD

There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth
made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, 13 and the 
stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when
shaken by a strong wind.

Revelation 6:12
```

##The *You and I* *verse*, my Universe

```
I'm gonna love you 
Till the heavens stop the rain 
I'm gonna love you 
Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I 
 
The Doors, Touch Me
```
