# The Lamb of God... IsLam

For 3 years I ran around the country, from the East all the way to the shores of California.  Songs are written about this trip, and it is literally the beginning of *the race* that is spoken about in the first words of the Burning Bush.  The linguistic link between the Passover Lamb and the name Islam is a hidden emphasis that directly links to the English idiom "on the lam."  *Iran*, like the name of the country, which hides another reference to this event.  Koran, ImRan, and the main character of Metroid: Sammas Aran.  All links between the words run, lamb and lam.  This battle between the Messiah and the land of Uncle Sam is the immediate precursor to the Trial of Christ and the cause of the *set up of the Beast of Revelation* which is prophesied in Isaiah 52:13.

###The Suffering and Glory of the Servant: See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.

Other translations use the words "he will be very high," and this link to drugs is part of the criticism of our justice system, and social necrosis.  I was very high, yet to be exalted, and very sure that the *speed* that Cake links to the race for the *holy grail* in their song "Going the Distance."  In Judaism the name of Christ is El Elyon which translates to *The God Most High.*  

###Reluctantly crouched at the starting line, Engines pumping and thumping in time. The green light flashes, the flags go up. Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup. 
###He's going the distance. He's going for speed.
###-Cake, Going the Distance

Live sings another song, "GAS hed Goes West," which discusses this trip in a near parallel to the defition of the Tarot Fool Card--one more Messianic reference.  GAS hed here is an acronym for "God and Satan," something that nobody but me would know.  In fact many people have wondered what this songs title means.  The second word, "hed" is a langolier reference to "a" not being included in the decision.  You see, like "New Testament" which tells that "a" (for Adam) didn't mean for it to be a test, but rather a walk through to help us succeed in a controlled system whose key is following the path of Christ in the book.

Point in fact, I was not doing drugs of my own volition, I was being *mind controlled* in what is a perfect example of how the system set up to "punish and correct" our society is destructive.  It is a lesson for Heaven not to *burn the day away*, chronicled in the book of Genesis.  This is the story of the near sacrifice of the son of Abram.

###He's a bonified man, a star amongst his clan. It's the memory that dies, our gas hed was right.  When they lanced his skull there was puss and light
###Take your photographs back.  For the love of all Gods.  Our gas hed marches on
###-Live, GAS Hed goes West

This mention of photographs links to the first commandment and a number of other songs which relate to the "burning of Isaac;" pictures taken of Adam naked in Eden.  I am hoping to show you that these are hidden references to a very real story; one that is secretly being sung about using the same technology which forced me to do drugs and "walk around naked in Egypt." Chronicled in *Isaiah 20.*  These three chapters, from 20 to 22 show very clearly that mind control is responsible for nakedness of Isaiah, and lack of forgiveness in 22 the cause of destruction.

###Eat, Drink and be Merry... for ((tomorrow the son rises.))  -Dave Matthews & ((ish))

In our history this phenomenon of secret messages in our music is archived in the story of Nero, fiddling on the roof as the fire burns down below.  The roof is Heaven, and the fire is proof of mind control.  

###If you want beautiful, have me in a picture. -The Verve Pipe, Photograph

###“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. -Exodus 20:4

This mind control was overtly shown to me, I was made to literally walk around like a robot; no small feat.  Forcing me to take drugs was the burning, the altar that nearly killed the Son.  At the same time God is chastising the Egyptians for this enslavement, he taught me how the technology works, and how it can be used for good, to help rectify the atrocities that have befallen our society.  Like I was forced, our streets are flooded with drugs, and our minds manipulated in what is nothing short of an attack on civilization itself.  The crack epidemic, and now the research chemicals flooding through the Postal Service from China shows how this war is being waged on multiple levels.  From the streets, to international drug war, to manipulation from what is the existant Heaven.  

Nero's fiddling... with our minds is well portrayed in a favorite poem of mine, one that I recited in high school.  In *The Touch of the Master's Hand* God is the auctioneer, who changes the worth of the violin he is selling, a metaphor for the salvation of our civilization coming from the Hand of God.

###He played a melody as pure and sweet as a carolling angel sings.

#Isa, Isaac, Jesus and Isaiah

Fundamental to understanding the apocalypse is seeing that these events are all the same story, being told over and over.  The Fall of Adam is the burning of Isaac, and the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  It is linked clearly in Isaiah 20 by showing us the nakedness of Adam is part of a mind controlled act of God.  

###At that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, “Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet.” And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot.
###Then the Lord said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt. 

Amoz brings this story into reality through cinema, our modern myth.  The stories of the Wizard of Oz and the HBO show clearly depict the Wizard being framed by the machine, whose name says that *the Land is Oz, and it is alive.*  This is a story of the Father who commanded Isaac to be burned, to imprison me in a Broward County Jail... and the reason the Emerald City is holy scripture come to life.

#The Trial of Jesus Christ
The run came to an end, and resulted in a very real trial, one which has put the idea of Jesus Christ existing on trial.  I was found to be incompetent to stand trial simply for telling the court that I am the messiah.  Disallowing a religious belief to be used as evidence, protected by the Constitution, resulted in the death of the idea of Jesus Christ.  

Just like many of the protagonists and victims in the Bible are all representative of the Messiah, the fathers are all God.  In the Biblical Promised Land of Joshua we find another story that connects the Old Testament and New.  The battle is the book of Judges is a abstract critique of these same events.  Samson, the son of Uncle Sam here, fighting for his life in a court room is protected by the strengh of character recognition.  In this story, it is the long hair of the messiah that now clearly reveals the hidden link between Judges and Jesus.
