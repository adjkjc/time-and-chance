# The Lamb of God... IsLam

For 3 years I ran around the country, from the East all the way to the shores of California.  Songs are written about this trip, and it is literally the beginning of *the race* that is spoken about in the first words of the Burning Bush.  The linguistic link between the Passover Lamb and the name Islam is a hidden emphasis that directly links to the English idiom "on the lam."  *Iran*, like the name of the country, which hides another reference to this event.  Koran, ImRan, and the main character of Metroid: Sammas Aran.  All links between the words run, lamb and lam.  

John 15:7 tells us that Jesus is the key; and this name is certainly the key to finding some Spanglish in our new langolier.  J "is" Us is a sort of "we are all Christ" statement hidden within his name.  This equality though is even more important because of another J name that confirms that "es" is truly "is."  Jeshurun, the name of the Chosen one from Isaiah 44 adds fuel to the fire by supplementing our Spanglish with some Shrew.. the Hebrew word for "is" is "hu."  And one more example of this "run" being totally messianic.

This battle between the Messiah and the land of Uncle Sam is the immediate precursor to the Trial of Christ and the cause of the *set up of the Beast of Revelation* which is prophesied in Isaiah 52:13.

###The Suffering and Glory of the Servant: See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.

Other translations use the words "he will be very high," and this link to drugs is part of the criticism of our justice system, and social necrosis.  I was very high, yet to be exalted, and very sure that the *speed* that Cake links to the race for the *holy grail* in their song "Going the Distance."  In Judaism the name of Christ is El Elyon which translates to *The God Most High.*  


```
Reluctantly crouched at the starting line, 
Engines pumping and thumping in time. 
The green light flashes, the flags go up. 
Churning and burning, they yearn for the cup. 

He's going the distance. He's going for speed.

-Cake, Going the Distance
```
Live sings another song, "GAS hed Goes West," which discusses this trip in a near parallel to the defition of the Tarot Fool Card--one more Messianic reference.  GAS hed here is an acronym for "God and Satan," something that nobody but me would know.  In fact many people have wondered what this songs title means.  The second word, "hed" is a langolier reference to "a" not being included in the decision.  You see, like "New Testament" which tells that "a" (for Adam) didn't mean for it to be a test, but rather a walk through to help us succeed in a controlled system whose key is following the path of Christ in the book.

Point in fact, I was not doing drugs of my own volition, I was being *mind controlled* in what is a perfect example of how the system set up to "punish and correct" our society is destructive.  It is a lesson for Heaven not to *burn the day away*, chronicled in the book of Genesis.  This is the story of the near sacrifice of the son of Abram.

```
He's a bonified man, a star amongst his clan. 
It's the memory that dies, our gas hed was right.  
When they lanced his skull there was puss and light

Take your photographs back.  
For the love of all Gods,  
Our gas hed marches on

-Live, GAS Hed goes West
```

This mention of photographs links to the first commandment and a number of other songs which relate to the "burning of Isaac;" pictures taken of Adam naked in Eden.  I am hoping to show you that these are hidden references to a very real story; one that is secretly being sung about using the same technology which forced me to do drugs and "walk around naked in Egypt." Chronicled in *Isaiah 20.*  These three chapters, from 20 to 22 show very clearly that mind control is responsible for nakedness of Isaiah, and lack of forgiveness in 22 the cause of destruction.

```
Eat, Drink and be Merry... 
for ((tomorrow the son rises again.)))  

-Dave Matthews & ((ish))
```

In our history this phenomenon of secret messages in our music is archived in the story of Nero, fiddling on the roof as the fire burns down below.  The roof is Heaven, and the fire is proof of mind control.  

```
If you want beautiful, have me in a picture. 
-The Verve Pipe, Photograph

“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, 
or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, 
or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in 
the water under the earth."

-Exodus 20:4
```

This mind control was overtly shown to me, I was made to literally walk around like a robot; no small feat.  Forcing me to take drugs was the burning, the altar that nearly killed the Son.  At the same time God is chastising the Egyptians for this enslavement, he taught me how the technology works, and how it can be used for good, to help rectify the atrocities that have befallen our society.  Like I was forced, our streets are flooded with drugs, and our minds manipulated in what is nothing short of an attack on civilization itself.  The crack epidemic, and now the research chemicals flooding through the Postal Service from China shows how this war is being waged on multiple levels.  From the streets, to international drug war, to manipulation from what is the existent Heaven.  

Nero's fiddling... with our minds is well portrayed in a favorite poem of mine, one that I recited in high school.  In *The Touch of the Master's Hand* God is the auctioneer, who changes the worth of the violin he is selling, a metaphor for the salvation of our civilization coming from the Hand of God.

###He played a melody as pure and sweet as a carolling angel sings.

The proof of mind control that is the fire burning below Nero's feet is lost on us today.  It is designed to be exposed, so that we will never again be slaves to hidden technology.  This is the reason that the same hidden story is being highlighted and sung about by so many unknowing prophets.  

```
Jump into the sun, 
Dear boy what are you running from? 
Run boy, be a man; cuz we're too weak to take a stand. 

-The Pretty Reckless, Absolution
```

Taylor Momsen's words came to me as this was happening, the song above was released.  It confirmed to me that what was happening; the run was destiny.  Just before leaving, I blasted *Nothing Left to Lose* on my car radio as I drove.  The lyrics of that song too, show reference to Nero and me.

```
Lost between ((Nero)) and ((Darth Vader)), 
if Jesus Christ and Rock 'n Roll can't save 
my ((immortal soul))... 
I've got *Nothing Left to Lose*.  

-The Pretty Reckless & *ish*
```

Similarly to Iran, our map of reality confirms that this story has been in the works since the beginning of time.  You see, God's statement that he is *ish* is just about to celebrate *Rumspringer*.  Amish.  Iran.  Amoz. 

#Isa, Isaac, Jesus and Isaiah

Fundamental to understanding the apocalypse is seeing that these events are all the same story, being told over and over.  The Fall of Adam is the burning of Isaac, and the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ.  It is linked clearly in Isaiah 20 by showing us the nakedness of Adam is part of a mind controlled act of God.  

```
At that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. 
He said to him, “Take off the sackcloth from your body 
and the sandals from your feet.” And he did so, going 
around stripped and barefoot.

Then the Lord said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has gone
stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign 
and portent against Egypt. 

Isaiah 20
```

Amoz brings this story into reality through cinema, our modern myth.  The stories of the Wizard of Oz and the HBO show clearly depict the Wizard being framed by the machine, whose name says that *the Land is Oz, and it is alive.*  This is a story of the Father who commanded Isaac to be burned, to imprison me in a Broward County Jail... and the reason the Emerald City is holy scripture come to life.

#The Trial of Jesus Christ
The run came to an end, and resulted in a very real trial, one which has put the idea of Jesus Christ existing on trial.  I was found to be incompetent to stand trial simply for telling the court that I am the messiah.  Disallowing a religious belief to be used as evidence, protected by the Constitution, resulted in the death of the idea of Jesus Christ.  

Just like many of the protagonists and victims in the Bible are all representative of the Messiah, the fathers are all God.  In the Biblical Promised Land of Joshua we find another story that connects the Old Testament and New.  The battle is the book of Judges is a abstract critique of these same events.  Samson, the son of Uncle Sam here, fighting for his life in a court room is protected by the strength of character recognition.  In this story, it is the long hair of the messiah that now clearly reveals the hidden link between Judges and Jesus.  

The name Samson links the angel of death, Samael to Uncle Sam; and this story that is decidedly American.  So sayeth Pro-me-the-US.

# Hidden Messages in Music

I was framed in 2012, arrested for possession of drugs that are the beginning of a story about a man on the run.  This story is part of a mythology Jesus Christ that links Superman and Spin Doctors, speed and Kryptonite.  It is through the songs that secretly talk about the events that I am going to describe that we find proof that they are truly about a real man, and that the angels are singing about it.

The idea that Jor-El and Kal-El are "Biblical" is not novel, though seeing that their names are pointers to "K" the bridge between the J of Jesus and the God El might be.  K is the element of Potassium, linked to Saturn through the acronyms that tie "Person of Time" to the "Ass" that humorously shows the two-person duality of Father and Son in "Saturn and Uranus." CK, Clark Kent, gains his strength from our "son," and this Biblical imagery alludes to the fact that I have received a great deal of insight from doing drugs, in solitude.  God was framing me, using the neurological effects of speed to give me clear visions and communicate the information that you are reading.  The crystals that are Kryptonite are also diamonds of wisdom, Zohar... the focus of so much lyrical light.  Through my struggle, I was placed in a position to comment on the social structure that we have surrounding drugs, addiction and rehabilitation.  More importantly on our justice system, and it is such a huge focus of religion that we have story after story to remind us.  Jeremiah was jailed, Jesus tried, Joseph enslaved... all allusions to what you are about to read about.

##Dear all of you left behind, you are walking dumb and blind, *blind*. -Taylor Momsen

More than proving a divine hand secretly influencing musicians, and more than placing me on the cross by causing the illegal search in 2012 that made all of this happen; the events that lead up to this run gave me the answers before you.  I was being reflexivly controlled, communication with God used as a carrot on a stick to walk me into the darkness that we call justice in America.  I was arrested by a Lighthouse Point police officer named Mike Search, and his name is no accident.  It is a highlight, to show that I was truly framed; and the ensuing legal battle alluded to in Judges and the NT is all "*fruit of the poisonous tree*" to tie us back to Eden and idioms.

Spin Doctors starts spinning the story a decade before it happened; singing about a marriage... The Marriage of the Lamb, in a song that begins to link The Pretty Reckless, Mike Search, and Adam together with Jim Morrison and ... well... I would a be a liar, if I were to say to you... I couldn't get much higher.

```
One has diamonds in his pockets
That's some bread, now
This one, said he wants to buy you rockets
Ain't in his head, now

Marry him, marry me?
I'm the one who loves you, baby... can't you see?

Spin Doctors, Two Princes
Pocket Full of Kryptonite
```

Nearly two decades later Taylor Momsen ties *Two Princes* and Superman to the story Jim Morrison began in the 70's; it's a call to her, from God, to Light (this story) Up.  In *Heaven Knows* she sings about Jimmy, maybe hersenf not even knowing that it is Jim Morrison--his name no accident either.  

###More? I'm the son.

```
Jimmy's in the back with pocket full of high, 
if you listen close, ((you will understand why.))

The Pretty Reckless, Heaven Knows & ((ish))
```

Between my "pockets full of high" and the "hidden links" between the Lamb, Superman, and Kryptonite... I hope it is becoming clear that this story is woven t hrough time.  I hear Jim Morrison singing to Taylor, begging on my behalf for help breaking the darkness and *setting the night on fire.*

These are the words of God.  I'm asking for a tweet, that's all we need to light the match and begin your "Absolution."  

```
